# Integrated-Appliance-System
##### Controllers for an Energy Efficient, Sustainable Appliance System.


The Integrated Appliance System is a Senior Design, or capstone project for the Department of Chemical & Environmental Engineering for UC Riverside, under the advisory of Dr. Kawai Tam. We aim to draft, design, and potentially market an energy combination of appliances that cut your electricity bill substantially. It's common knowledge that appliances such as washers and dryers in typical residential homes are among the highest in terms of energy consumption. We're an interdisciplinary team that consists of Chemical, Environmental, Mechanical, and Computer Engineering majors. In a nut shell, the design utilizes solar thermal energy to heat up clothes, and taking the surplus energy to be routed into a water heater or into a home as warm air for heating, thus replacing a clothes dryer, water heater, and space heater. Being pretty savvy in embedded systems, I was reached out to implement a control system for the appliances. 


### Subsystems

##### IAS-PCB
Collection of Eagle PCB CAD files that contain prototype/production-ready schematic and board layouts for the IAS.


##### Integrated Appliance System
Contains the Atmel Project source for the ATmega1284-PU work.


##### Raspberry-Pi-Logger
Contains logic for a temporary method of controlling the IAS, utilizing startup scripts to log temperature and humidity data.
